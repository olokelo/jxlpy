# JXLPy

This module introduces reading and writing support for JPEG XL directly from Python 3.

JXLPy is based on JPEG XL implementation in [imagecodecs](https://github.com/cgohlke/imagecodecs) but doesn't it require Numpy and any external dependencies besides Cython and [libjxl](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl).

It also provides support for Pillow via plugin.

**This project is still in alpha stages and needs testing. It may contain bugs!**

## Install via PIP

```shell
$ pip install jxlpy
```
or
```shell
$ pip install jxlpy[pillow]
```
if you intend to use the Pillow extension.

## Build it yourself

* Make sure you are using Python 3.x and pip for that version

* Build and install libjxl according to instructions [here](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl#building)

* Install patchelf and auditwheel

  ```shell
  $ sudo apt-get install patchelf
  $ pip install auditwheel
  ```

* For Pillow plugin, make sure that Pillow is installed *(optional)*

  ```shell
  $ pip install ---upgrade pillow
  ```

* Clone this repository

  ```shell
  $ git clone https://github.com/olokelo/jxlpy
  $ cd jxlpy
  ```

* Build wheels

  ```shell
  $ pip wheel .
  ```

* Use auditwheel to put necessary libraries into your wheel

  ```shell
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
  $ python -m auditwheel repair --plat linux_x86_64 jxlpy-*.whl
  ```
* Install newly created wheel

  ```shell
  $ cd wheelhouse
  $ pip install jxlpy-*.whl
  ```

* Now you should be good to go :)

  You can run examples to check if everything works correctly

*Installation steps were tested on Ubuntu 20.04*
